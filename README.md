Toontown Gag Combo Generator is a script that generates optimal combos for one-shotting cogs. The script's priority is to output the combo which minimizes the resources used (lower level gags preferred) while dealing sufficient damage. The output of the combo is influenced by the following input, describing the state of the battle:
* Cog level
* Gag track to be used (additionally a stun track if using drop)
* Number of toons
* Cog lured or unlured

The purpose of this script was to populate a database with the 360 possible combo outputs, versus running the script and generating the combos on the fly. The web app which queries a database for combos generated by this script can be found at https://toonkit.net/rewritten/combos.
